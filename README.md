PizzaPal Data Analysis
Project Overview
Welcome to the PizzaPal Data Analysis project README. PizzaPal is a pizza restaurant chain startup that initially began in 2015 but faced closure within a year due to business disputes and circumstances. Now, PizzaPal is relaunching and aiming to reestablish itself in the market. As a data analyst, I delved into their past sales data to uncover insights into their business operations. I focused on the most ordered pizzas, categories, and total revenues, which are grouped and discussed based on the different KPIs and Metrics.
Analysis Scope
The analysis involved querying the PizzaPal database using SQL to answer various questions and derive meaningful insights. Lastly, to make the findings more communicative with stakeholders, I used Power BI, enclosed with Data Cleaning, Data Modelling, and Calculating Columns using DAX and the appropriate Charts.
KPIs Identified
The KPIs are divided into three significant understandings of the business:
1. Sales Performance:
Discusses the total number of orders placed and calculates total revenue, including the top 5 ordered pizzas and the top 3 pizzas that generated the most revenue.
2. Operational Efficiency:
Determining Operational Efficiency is not only a cost-benefit approach but also dynamically handles the best customer service and business operations by taking time as a constraint. Here, I have identified order distribution analysis and category-wise Analysis.
3. Strategic Insights
This determines the profit margin for each category and the cumulative revenue generated during the business run.
